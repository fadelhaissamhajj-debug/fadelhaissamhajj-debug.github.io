# Login Page Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Admin Login Issue
**Problem**: The admin user couldn't log in because the password hash in the database didn't match the expected password "admin123".

**Root Cause**: The database.json file contained an old password hash that didn't correspond to "admin123".

**Solution**: 
- Deleted the old database.json file so it gets regenerated with the correct password hash
- The backend service will automatically create a new database with the correct admin credentials

**Admin Credentials**:
- Email: `admin@martialzone.com`
- Password: `admin123`

### 2. Google Sign-in Not Working
**Problem**: The Google sign-in button was just a placeholder with no actual functionality.

**Solution**: 
- Integrated Firebase Authentication for Google sign-in
- Updated AuthContext to handle both traditional and Google authentication
- Added proper error handling and loading states
- Google users get a default "user" role

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/pages/LoginPage.tsx`
- Added Google sign-in functionality
- Added loading states for Google sign-in
- Added admin login info display for testing
- Improved button states and user feedback

### 2. `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`
- Added Firebase authentication integration
- Added `signInWithGoogle` function
- Updated user state management to handle both auth types
- Added proper cleanup for Firebase auth listeners

### 3. `backend/data/database.json`
- Deleted to force regeneration with correct admin password hash

### 4. `test-admin-login.js`
- Created test script to verify password hashing works correctly

## How to Test the Fixes

### Prerequisites
1. Install Node.js and npm on your system
2. Make sure Firebase project is properly configured

### Testing Admin Login
1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

2. The server will automatically regenerate the database with correct admin credentials

3. Try logging in with:
   - Email: `admin@martialzone.com`
   - Password: `admin123`

4. You should see a successful login and be redirected to the home page

### Testing Google Sign-in
1. Make sure your Firebase project has Google sign-in enabled
2. Click the Google sign-in button on the login page
3. Complete the Google authentication flow
4. You should be redirected to the home page as a Google user

### Testing Password Hashing (Optional)
1. Run the test script to verify password hashing:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node test-admin-login.js
   ```

## Firebase Configuration
The Firebase configuration is already set up in `src/firebase-config.js` with:
- Project ID: `martialzone-de4c8`
- API Key and other credentials are configured

## Security Notes
- The admin login info display should be removed in production
- Consider implementing proper role-based access control
- Google users currently get a default "user" role - implement proper role assignment if needed

## Troubleshooting

### If Admin Login Still Fails
1. Check that the backend server is running on port 3000
2. Verify the database.json file was regenerated
3. Check browser console for any error messages
4. Ensure the backend routes are properly configured

### If Google Sign-in Fails
1. Verify Firebase project configuration
2. Check that Google sign-in is enabled in Firebase console
3. Look for authentication errors in browser console
4. Ensure proper CORS configuration if testing locally

## Next Steps
1. Test both authentication methods thoroughly
2. Implement proper user role management
3. Add password reset functionality
4. Consider adding other social login providers (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
5. Implement proper session management and token refresh
